### Notes

1. Supervisor **MN** introduced area of study *Facial recognition and machine learning [http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/people/mnicolaou](http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/people/mnicolaou "About Research")*
2. **DF** Explained main area of his interest would be Game Development:
	
> Sort of FPS shooter or Zombie survival kind of game.

3. **WC** Explained about idea of Artificial Pancreas concept:

> The basic idea being that we could develop a tool which allowed a insulin pump to 
automatically deliver insulin when the wearers blood glucose level increases which could be triggered by eating food. It would involve have a insulin pump, continuous glucose monitor *(CGM)* and a way of controlling and reading both devices over Bluetooth.

4. **MN** Commented that it could be possible combine the ideas into a medical type game, however it could become a research project as there are few ways to combine the project effectively

5. **AK** Explained his area of interest:
 
> A way to combine gaming and the raspberry pi

6. **GH** Explained his idea and interest:

> Previously has developed multiple level platform shooter, which could be developed on and improved/involved into a larger game

7. After looking at the projects it was consider that a game could be developed to combine data from the player (heart rate / blood pressure) to increase the stress of the game based on those readings. *For example when the game sees you being scared it makes the game even more scary or times jump scares with peaks in heart rate*
